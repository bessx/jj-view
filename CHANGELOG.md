# Changelog

## 1.15.2

### Fixed
- **Fixed Silent Failures in Diffs and Merge Conflicts**: Moved `diffedit` operations—used to capture changes for **diff views** and **merge conflict resolution**—to platform-native shell and batch scripts. This resolves a bug where the extension would fail silently if the `node` binary was not explicitly in the system `PATH`, resulting in broken diff views and unresponsive merge conflict resolution.
